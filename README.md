### 1. Use Virtual Machine (OVA)

*Wazuh provides a pre-built virtual machine image (OVA) that you can directly import using VirtualBox or other OVA compatible virtualization systems. Take into account that this VM only runs on 64-bit systems and does not provide high availability and scalability of the product.*
